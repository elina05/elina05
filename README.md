- 👋 Hi, I’m @elina05
- 👀 I’m interested in beautiful designs and how I can do it. I want to learn this. If we speaks not about computers I am a creative person, I like to do hand mades
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basic front end, programming language JavaScript and html, css. In school I got two or three certificate of completion from the company "code". And then I won two books. It was Python and JavaScript for kids. I did not understand anything in it and that is why I sold those books. But everything come back
